# PulseEHR

**Overview**

PulseEHR is a console-based **Java** application that simulates a simplified **Electronic Health Record (EHR)** system.
The project focuses on demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, and basic data management concepts within a healthcare-inspired context.

The system allows users to manage patient records by adding, searching, updating, deleting, viewing and persisting patient data to files for future use.

**Why it matters**

This project was developed to:

- Handle real-world patient data with file-based persistence
- Apply object-oriented principles to build maintainable, extendable code
- Portfolio-ready project showcasing practical programming skills in health and computing

**Patient File Format**

The system reads and writes CSV-style files:  
- Name Surname, dateOfBirth, gender, address, phone, email, medicalHistory, medication
- Ntombi Kubheka,2000-12-30,Female,12 Imagine Street,0110001111,ntombikubhekanoneexist@gmail.com,None,None
- Thabo Dlamini,1995-06-15,Male,45 Freedom Avenue,0123456789,thabodlamininoneexist@gmail.com,Asthma,Ventolin


The file must be located in the same directory as the compiled classes when the program runs.
